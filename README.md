# VR-Researh-Situation-Worldwide

This is a project in Database System course.

In this project, we merged the metadata of around 1100 articles in VR study field with some information about the background of the researchers or their affiliations, in order to look into the social-environmental factors that influenced the research productions in this field. We also set up the corresponding relational model and PostgreSQL database. We imported the data into the database after pre-processing the data, and developed a web application via R-studio.

In 'document', there is detailed description about these steps decribed above.

The data tables we got after pre-processing are stored in 'tables'.

There are three charts in 'visualize' file, which are to present the data in a visualized way. 

'ERM' shows the entity relational model of our project. And 'relational model' is the relational model.

In 'proj.zip' file stores the web application, i.e.'app.r'. It is required to open all the csv files in 'proj.zip' to run the app.
